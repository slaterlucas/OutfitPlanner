## Project Proposal 

300-1000 words total across all of the sections below

### Description of Problem/Opportunity

Today's children often face challenges with maintaining attention due to the numerous distractions presented by digital media and technology. This shorter attention span can make it difficult for them to engage deeply with educational content, particularly in subjects that require consistent focus and practice, such as mathematics. The need for innovative methods to hold their interest in learning is becoming increasingly crucial to help them overcome these challenges and succeed academically.

### Proposed Solution/Approach

To address these attention span challenges, an AI-driven educational tool leverages the popular and engaging world of Pokémon to captivate children's interest. By weaving math problems into stories about children's favorite Pokémon characters, the AI assistant makes learning interactive and fun. This method not only keeps children engaged but also helps them develop their math skills in a context that feels more like play than work. The tool can adjust the difficulty of the problems based on the child's progress, ensuring that they are always challenged but not overwhelmed, thereby promoting a deeper understanding and sustained interest in learning.

## Self-Evaluation

The project aimed to integrate educational math problems into Pokémon-themed stories, leveraging an AI-driven approach to enhance engagement and learning among children. This evaluation assesses the fulfillment of our project goals and examines the effectiveness of our metrics. Our first goal was to create an AI-powered educational tool that could blend math problems with Pokémon stories to capture and sustain children's attention. While the concept was solid and well-received by education professionals and peers, technical challenges limited full execution. Specifically, the integration between the Pokémon API and our voice-activated chatbot faced issues, causing disruptions in the intended seamless user experience. Despite these hurdles, the prototype showed potential in engaging children during initial tests. The objective was for the AI to adapt to various learning styles and paces. While we implemented foundational adaptive features, real-world effectiveness in personalizing learning experiences could only be thoroughly evaluated through extended usage and data collection, which is beyond what we are currently able to do as Vanderbilt students. We intended to use Pokémon-themed narratives to extend the duration of children's focus on math tasks. Initial feedback was promising, indicating that the stories were engaging. However, we were not able to collect any data on how effective this was as we do not have acsess to any formal studies. We can however say that the concept is a fun idea and we did have some fun playing with it. Our goal to demonstrate measurable academic improvements was ambitious. Without the capability to conduct controlled, long-term studies, we cannot conclusively claim academic enhancements. We were unable to measure actual improvements in math skills through pre- and post-tests. This metric remains speculative, and future iterations of the project would benefit from a structured evaluation approach. User retention metrics were not obtainable in our current development phase. Future versions of the app should include analytics capabilities to track and improve user engagement and retention. While we did not conduct formal surveys, the informal feedback from discussions with parents and educators was highly positive. Many recognized the educational value of combining learning with popular cultural themes like Pokémon.

## Reflection on Learning

We went through many stages of ideation, our first being an outfit planner which was my original project proposal. While we were able to implement a computer vision model on Pycharm, we were unable to be able to correctly identify specific clothing objects. An example of this would be we gave the model 5 different types of pants, like jeans, cargos, and khakis, and it replied that all of them were just blue jeans. We also had trouble with identifying colors, as there were essentially no open-source models on huggingface that allowed us to do this. After these technical difficulties, we came up with another idea, combining my studies in Spanish with Soham's studies in Medicine, Health, and Society. This was a chatbot that would be powered by speech, replying with diagrams and other audio to help address medical emergencies, we thought this would be a good idea as we know there is some technological illiteracy, and also just illiteracy in some Latin American countries. This fell flat after we got our speech-to-text chatbot working, as we were not able to incorporate image generation or replies in voice-activated text. Our next idea was then a way to make education more fun, which is the idea we finalized. Through this process of ideation, I learned so much about the different capabilities of AI, and how complicated it can be to build projects. There would be times when Soham and I would sit down and experiment for a couple of hours with nothing to show for it at the end. But, I believe this process of trying and failing helped me learn a lot. I now feel like I understand much more of the backend of projects, and was also inspired by working on this. I feel like I learned a substantial amount in the time I worked on it, to the point where if I was working like this every day over the summer I would know so much about building AI-based applications. I would love to be able to complete all the ideas I have, as I feel like all of the ones I tried for this project would genuinely be very useful. I also loved the idea of combining our two majors with the project, as it shows how AI can really be used in any discipline. Overall, while I failed a lot, I am very happy about all the things I learned along the way of doing this final project. I really enjoyed the process of ideation, as well as trying to create projects. If I was actually able to fully implement this education idea, I feel like it could genuinely be useful and help people learn, especially with the attention span issues nowadays. In my future learning, I would love to dive further into the topic of AI, but more specifically learn the skills to be able to create things with AI. For example, if we had a class where the goal was building things weekly with AI, I would now change my schedule around to accommodate this. One easy thing I could do is try to learn Python, as it seems as though this is what is used often. Overall, I hope to continue to learn and grow in this field, and am greatfull for the things I learned in this class. 

## What's Next?

I want to keep working on this project, but with my current technical background, it can be very frustrating to work on, as I feel clueless when I encounter an error. The first thing I would fix is to make the project fully functioning, as well as incorporating some sort of Math API, and an image generator, to make the stories more immersive. Maybe I could even incorporate text-to-speech for when there is a dialogue in the storylines. I hope Chat GPT advances to the point where it can code without errors for someone, or I can take a class focused on the coding aspects of AI. This class was a great introduction to the field, but learning more about training my own models and building applications would unleash my potential a lot more. I also love the idea of combining AI with other things I learn at school, and potentially trying to include it in projects for non-engineering related classes. For example, I just had to do a Spanish project on creating a business plan for a restaurant, something that you could make a GPT assistant to aid you in. I think the opportunities are endless and I am excited for the future of AI.
