# Outfit Planner
Deciding what to wear every day is a small yet significant task that consumes time and mental energy. For individuals with busy schedules or for those who prefer to minimize daily decision-making to focus on more critical tasks (echoing Mark Zuckerberg's approach of wearing only zip-up sweaters to reduce choice fatigue), selecting daily outfits can be an unnecessary burden. This project aims to streamline the process of choosing outfits by leveraging AI to create a personal outfit planner assistant.

Project Notes:

- Please remember to keep your repo private when you create it from this template.
- Be sure to create your report in the **intro-gen-ai** organization. 
- The name of the repo should be the name of the project, or a shortened version of the name.
- Each section should be completed by the deadline indicated. You submit by making a commit of this README.md file. Except for minor edits, please do no change the Proposal, Goals, or Metrics sections after the submission deadline.
- General guidance on formatting writing in markdown files (like this README.md file) is at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax.
- There is a [recording of the the class discussion on the use of this template](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/rec/share/RjihScz0Ti7RId0KMj7GWBc8XueS571_JnFqDQwli0AuKLsgaau0j_RcphBjwYtV.HP10ROf2TwPUn6TA?startTime=1697553005000).
- You can sign up for a time to discuss your ideas for the project at https://calendly.com/jesse-spencer-smith. We'll also be discussing project in class on Tuesday after Fall Break.
- Remember that there is an AI Showcase on April 19 (with prizes for Best in Show), so you might want to consider completing your project by then.

## Project Proposal 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words total across all of the sections below

### Description of Problem/Opportunity

Choosing an outfit involves considering various factors: the occasion, weather, personal style, and even laundry schedules. This daily decision can lead to decision fatigue, where the quality of decisions deteriorates after a long session of decision-making. Furthermore, many people have clothes in their wardrobes that they rarely wear, either because they forget about them or can't find the right occasion or combination. An AI-driven outfit planner can optimize this process by providing personalized outfit suggestions, ensuring wardrobe utilization, and saving time.

### Proposed Solution/Approach

The proposed solution is an AI-based outfit planner assistant that catalogs the user's wardrobe and generates outfit combinations based on various parameters. Users will initially scan all items in their closet using a mobile or web application. The AI will then categorize these items by type, color, fabric, and occasion suitability. Based on this data, the AI will create numerous possible outfit combinations, considering factors such as weather forecasts, user preferences, and outfit repetition. The system will learn from user feedback to refine future suggestions, becoming more personalized over time.

### Project Outline and Timeline

Week 1: Research and Development
Conduct research on existing outfit planner apps and AI technologies suitable for image recognition and personalization.
Begin developing the core algorithm for categorizing clothing and generating outfit combinations.
Week 2: Prototype Development
Develop a basic prototype that can accept wardrobe inputs and generate outfit suggestions.
Start working on the user interface design.
Week 3: Testing and Feedback
Test the prototype internally and with a select group of users for feedback.
Refine the algorithm and user interface based on feedback.
Week 4: Final Development
Finalize the app development, focusing on user experience and AI performance.
Prepare for launch and promotional activities.
Week 5: Launch
Launch the outfit planner app to a broader audience.
Monitor for issues and feedback for immediate fixes.

## Goals of project 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 
### Goal 1 
Develop an easy-to-use, efficient AI-powered outfit planner that significantly reduces the time and effort required to choose daily outfits.
### Goal 2
Ensure the application's AI is capable of learning and adapting to the user's preferences and style over time, improving the personalization of outfit suggestions.
### Goal 3
Achieve a significant reduction in the time users spend deciding on outfits each week, demonstrating the app's efficiency and impact on daily routines.

## Project Metrics 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 
### Metric 1 
User satisfaction will be measured through surveys and app reviews. A satisfaction level of 80% or higher will be considered a success (A), 60-79% as satisfactory (B), and below 60% as needing improvement (C).
### Metric 2
The rate at which the app encourages the use of previously underutilized items in the wardrobe. A utilization increase of 30% or more is an A, 15-29% is a B, and less than 15% is a C.
### Metric 3
Measure the average time users spend deciding on outfits before and after using the app. A reduction of 50% or more in decision-making time will be considered excellent (A), 30-49% reduction will be viewed as good (B), and a reduction of less than 30% will need improvement (C).
